Superalgos is a comprehensive data processing and trading automation system that enables users to control every aspect of the *intelligence* required to be successful at trading.

We don't think of intelligence as the outcome of a good trading strategy. Instead, intelligence is the effective use of every resource available, including but not limited to:

* strategies;
* raw market datasets (trades, orders, etc.);
* elaborate datasets (indicators, studies, etc.);
* infrastructure (trading bot, processes, workflows, etc.).

You've gone through the very basic operation of the system that allows you to use existing strategies.

The rest of this User Manual covers the power use of the system, which involves modifying existing strategies and building your own, going through a thorough testing process and trading live.

You will also learn to take control of what happens under the hood, so that you may decide *how* you are going to do your job.

For example, you will learn to:

* define which processes run in your machine and how;
* determine what datasets you will work with;
* modify and create your own datasets.
