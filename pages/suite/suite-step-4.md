The <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.concepts.workspace}}">workspace</a> is an important concept within Superalgos. It is the entity that holds all the information handled by the system. In practical terms, it is a file that can be backed up, shared, and restored in the system.

{% include important.html content="For your convenience, the system ships with a default workspace that is restored automatically the first time you fire up the system. If this is the first time you are running the system, you may skip the following notes and go straight to the next step." %}

## If You Are Upgrading to a New Version of Superalgos

Once you run the new version of Superalgos for the first time, the system loads a new workspace. If you wish to restore previous work you may have backed up, you may proceed to do so now.
