The first time you run the system, you see a screen split in half. The top half features the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.charting_space.charting_space}}">charting space</a> and the bottom half features the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.concepts.design_space}}">design space</a>.

{% include /reuse/switch-from-charting-space-to-design-space.md content="yes" extended="no" %}

{% include important.html content="In the beginning, all charts are empty, but as time passes, candles start showing up on the charts, like in the image. If you still don't see data on the charts, do not worry, and keep learning the basics, following the next few steps." %}

**The design space** is the place where you create. Think of the design space as the control room of the system. This is where you control every aspect of your data, your trading strategies, your infrastructure, and the overall behavior of the system.

**The charting space** shows the charts, which feature market data, indicators, and&mdash;eventually&mdash;the actions of trading strategies. This is the section of the system in which you monitor markets and analyze the progress and results of your strategies.

{% include tip.html content="Pulling the slider to the top of the screen causes the charting space to stop consuming resources and gives an ample view of the design space. Pulling the slider to the bottom causes the design space to stop consuming resources and offers a full-screen view of the charting space." %}
