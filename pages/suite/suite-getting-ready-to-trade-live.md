To start forward-testing or live-trading with your own strategy, you need to follow the same steps explained in the *Getting Started* guide.

Not mentioned there is the following detail:

Make sure the following nodes are present in your strategy. If they are not, simply add them: go to the _Open Stage_ node and select _Add Open Execution_ on the menu; do the same with the _Close Stage_, adding _Close Execution_). No need to configure anything, simply make sure the nodes are there).

| Icon | Node | Stage |

As soon as you click *Run* in your session, your bot will be forward testing or trading live. What happens is that you are still running a simulationâ€”thus all the simulation layers keep plotting the same kind of information over the Charts.

The difference is that orders will now go to the exchange.

**For maximum efficiency, we recommend you run live trading sessions on the 01-min time frame. Your bot will then be executed every 60 seconds to evaluate your strategy rules and decide if any action needs to be taken.**

 This is important even if your strategy operates at a lower frequency, as running the live session at the 01-min time frame guarantees that the trading bot will exit trades as soon as the one-minute candle closes tagging your stop or take profit target. On the contrary, if you run the live trading session at a time frame higher than 01-min, slippage when closing the position may be considerably greater.
