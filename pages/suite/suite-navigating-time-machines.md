<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.charting_space.time_machine}}">Time machines</a> are *in focus* when they are pointed with the mouse.

**1. To pan the data within a time machine**, left-click within the time machine and drag. You may also use the keyboard as follows:

1. <kbd>&#8592;</kbd> to pan to the left.
1. <kbd>&#8594;</kbd> to pan to the right.
1. <kbd>&#8593;</kbd> to pan upwards.
1. <kbd>&#8595;</kbd> to pan downwards.

{% include note.html content="When using the keyboard, the time machine that is in focus is affected by the commands." %}

**2. To pan the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.charting_space.viewport}}">viewport</a> instead of the data in a time machine**, right-click and drag. This may be useful when zoomed deep into a time machine and you wish to reach one of its borders. You may also use the keyboard as follows:

1. <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>&#8592;</kbd> to pan to the left.
1. <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>&#8594;</kbd> to pan to the right.
1. <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>&#8593;</kbd> to pan upwards.
1. <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>&#8595;</kbd> to pan downwards.
