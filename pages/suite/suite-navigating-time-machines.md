<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.charting_space.time_machine}}">Time machines</a> that are visible are said to be *in focus*.

**1. To pan the data within a time machine**, left-click within the time machine and drag. You may also use the keyboard as follows:

1. <kbd>&#8592;</kbd> to pan to the left.
1. <kbd>&#8594;</kbd> to pan to the right.
1. <kbd>&#8593;</kbd> to pan upwards.
1. <kbd>&#8595;</kbd> to pan downwards.

{% include note.html content="When using the keyboard, every time machine in focus is affected by the commands." %}

**2. To pan the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.charting_space.viewport}}">viewport</a> instead of the data in a time machine**, right-click and drag. This may be useful when zoomed deep into a time machine and you wish to reach one of its borders. You may also use the keyboard as follows:

1. <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>&#8592;</kbd> to pan to the left.
1. <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>&#8594;</kbd> to pan to the right.
1. <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>&#8593;</kbd> to pan upwards.
1. <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>&#8595;</kbd> to pan downwards.

{% include /charting_space/time-machine.md heading="more" icon="150-" adding="" configuring="" charts="" content="yes" definition="bold" table="yes" more="yes"%}

{% include /charting_space/timeline-chart.md heading="more" icon="150-" adding="" configuring="" charts="" content="yes" definition="bold" table="yes" more="yes"%}

**3. To zoom square into a time machine**, double click on the chart. This action sets the chart on the middle of the screen and zooms in the viewport to the point in which the scale boxes become active. Double click on the chart again to go further in with the zoom, to the point in which layer managers become active.

{% include note.html content="This last feature is available only when the current zoom is at the furthest point, that is, when the viewport is completely zoomed-out." %}
