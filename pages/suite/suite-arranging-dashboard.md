Each of the charts you see in the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.charting_space.viewport}}">viewport</a> is actually a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.charting_space.time_machine}}">time machine</a>. Time machines are represented by rectangular elements with dark-turquoise boundaries.

Time machines may feature one or more <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.charting_space.timeline_chart}}">timeline charts</a>, right inside them. In other words, timeline charts live within time machines.

**1. To move a time machine around the viewport** hit the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key, left-click on the time machine, and move it to your preferred location.

**2. To adjust the size of a time machine** left-click and drag a border. The operation affects the size of the time machine without affecting the scale.

**3. To adjust the size of a time machine keeping the same data in view** right-click and drag a border. The operation affects the size of the time machine and, at the same time, adjusts the scale so that the same data remains in view.
