This video series focuses on the "how to" aspect of building an indicator. It does not go through definitions nor does it explain the underlying concepts. Therefore, it is highly recommended to read the [data mines](suite-data-mines.html) page as well as the pages about [indicator bots](suite-indicator-bots.html) before attempting to build an indicator. 

{% include note.html content="Reading the whole documentation on indicators and plotters is certainly desirable and will save you time in the long run." %}
