Superalgos is a large system and the learning curve may be a little steep. In the beginning, you may feel a bit lost, and in an attempt to make something work, you may accidentally detach nodes from their hierarchies, remove references, delete nodes, or even entire data structures.

If basic things are not working for you as expected and you think the issue may be that you accidentally broke something, do not panic! You can always go back to the original release settings by restoring a workspace.
