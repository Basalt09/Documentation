Once you fire up the system, *things* start happening on the console and on the browser...

## On the Console

Node JS runs several servers&mdash;the server side of the system&mdash;on the same console window.

{% include note.html content="The console must be open for as long as the system is running. Feel free to minimize it, but keep in mind it will later display valuable information." %}

## On the Browser

The system opens your default browser and loads the web application functioning as a user interface. 

{% include tip.html content="You should either <a href='https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95417?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en' rel='nofollow' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>set Chrome as your default browser</a> before firing up the system, or simply close the non-Chrome browser, open Chrome, and go to <a href='http://localhost:9999/' rel='nofollow' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>http://localhost:9999/</a>." %}

This is what you should see on your browser:
