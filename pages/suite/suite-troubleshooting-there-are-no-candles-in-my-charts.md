If you are just getting started with Superalgos, still following the getting started guide, bear in mind it takes time for data to be downloaded from the exchange. Depending on the power of your hardware and the speed of your internet connection, it may take anything from half an hour to several hours to see the first few candles, particularly those of the Binance exchange, as the market spans back to September 2017.

Check the data mining operation on the network hierarchy. You will be able to see candles on the screen only after the OCHLV Sensor Bot and the Candles Volumes indicator in the Masters task manager of the corresponding exchange tasks node and market have both reached 100% progress.
