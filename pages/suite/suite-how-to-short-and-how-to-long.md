When installing a new market, several sets of structures of nodes are created in different sections of different hierarchies. A subset of those structures covers the infrastructure required to run trading tasks on the installed market.

At this point, there is no automated process to create a parallel infrastructure to run trading tasks on more than one trading system in the same market.

The video tutorial below explains the infrastructure required and walks you through the process to do just that, assuming the market is already installed.
