It is highly recommended to read at least the [data mines](suite-data-mines.html) and [indicator bot](suite-indicator-bots.html) pages before attempting to build an indicator. Reading the whole documentation on indicators and plotters is certainly desirable and will save you time in the long run, as the video series does not provide definitions and focuses mainly on the *how to* aspect.
