To build each release, the Superalgos Platform used to draw code from several repositories within the Superalgos Github organization, as well as from organizations belonging to different teams. This has changed.

* The ```develop``` branch in the <a href="https://github.com/Superalgos/Superalgos/" rel="nofollow" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Superalgos repository</a> now features the latest codebase and development environment.

* The ```master``` branch now features the latest stable version of Superalgos.

The codebase is distributed with the release and constitutes a fully functional development environment right out of the package. The system runs uncompiled on the actual code (```node run``` from the root folder).
