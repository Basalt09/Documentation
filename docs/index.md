## About this Documentation

This is the documentation site for the Superalgos Project, as described [on the website](https://superalgos.org/).

This documentation is currently work in progress and corresponds to the latest stable version of Superalgos Suite. The system has experienced a major shift on multiple fronts, and changes are still being documented.

The current pages cover all the basic aspects of the concepts entailed in the system. That is, most concepts native to Superalgos and technical details of the system are covered already.

Pending work includes:

* Completing the last few steps of the *Getting started guide*.

* Documentation-wide illustrations.

* *How to* pages and specific *use cases*.

## Beta Stage Notice

This is a pre-release in beta stage. The system is under heavy development. We appreciate your help in testing the system and reporting any errors you may experience. We will keep improving user experience with your feedback.

{% include important.html content="Superalgos is at an early stage of development. As such, errors may occur at any point, including errors that may cause you to lose money. You are responsible for taking all precautions before starting trading live. Make sure you forward-test with small amounts of money, the kind you can afford losing. Trade live at your own risk." %}
