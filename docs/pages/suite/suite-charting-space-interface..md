When you open the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.charting_space.charting_space}}">charting space</a>, you are actually looking at it through a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.charting_space.viewport}}">viewport</a>. You may see several charts, depending on the setup of your current <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.concepts.workspace}}">workspace</a>.

**1. To move around the viewport**, right-click and drag. You may also use the wheel of the mouse to zoom in and out.

{% include note.html content="Notice how the viewport navigation resembles the navigation in *Google Maps*. You zoom out for the big picture. You zoom in for a closer view of any particular chart to get the details. Keep zooming in and you get the immersive experience... the *street view* of the market." %}

{% include /charting_space/viewport.md heading="more" icon="150-" adding="" configuring="" charts="" content="yes" definition="bold" table="yes" more="yes"%}
