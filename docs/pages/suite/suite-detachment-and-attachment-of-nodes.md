{% include note.html content="The verbs *to chain* and *to attach* may be used interchangeably, as synonyms. Similarly, *to unchain* and *to detach* are both valid." %}

To detach a node, right-click on it and drag it away from the parent node. To attach a node, right-click on it and move it closer to the node you wish to attach it to. 

Nodes may be attached only to potential parents. The system limits the way in which nodes may be attached, according to the logic of the information they contain.

Nodes may not be detached or attached to frozen nodes. You need to unfreeze them before attaching or detaching.
