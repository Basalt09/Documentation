The <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.concepts.workspace}}">workspace</a> is an important concept within Superalgos. It is the entity that holds all the information handled by the system. In practical terms, it is a file that can be backed up, shared, and restored in the system.

For your convenience, the system ships with a default workspace containing a ready-to-use set-up.

## Start Here

**1. Locate the file ```Share - My Workspace.json```** in the root of the ```Superalgos-master``` folder.

**2. Left-click on the file and drag it over the browser** where the system is running. You will notice the system recognizes your intent and pulls de slider up, showing the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.concepts.design_space}}">design space</a>.

**3. Drop the workspace file on the design space** and wait for a few seconds. You should see a ring around the workspace icon, indicating the progress of the import action. Once the ring dissappears, the import operation is over an you are free to start using the system.
