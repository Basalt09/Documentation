The first time you run the system, you see a screen split in half. The top half features the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.charting_space.charting_space}}">charting space</a> and the bottom half features the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.concepts.design_space}}">design space</a>.

Use the control in the center of the turquoise bar to pull the slider up and down to make more room for either space.

You may also use the keyboard as follows:

1. <kbd>Ctrl or &#8984;</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>&#8593;</kbd> to close the charting space and open the design space.

**The design space** is the place where you create. Think of the design space as the control room of the system. This is where you will control every aspect of your data, your trading strategies, your infrastructure, and the overall behavior of the system.

**The charting space** shows the charts, which feature market data, indicators, and&mdash;eventually&mdash;the actions of trading strategies. This is the section of the system in which you will monitor markets and analyze the progress and results of your strategies.
