It may happen that your simulation or live trading is not working as expected. The first thing to do in such a case is to turn on the *Formulas & Conditions* layer of the corresponding session and look around within your workspace. Errors are signaled with a red circle surrounding the relevant node of the workspace. Hover the mouse pointer over the node and you should get a description of what is that is causing the unexpected behavior.

Bear in mind that when the split tab is fully closed, errors will no longer show up in the design space, as shown in the below video:
