This *Getting Started Guide* will quickly show you the very basics of Superalgos so that you may rapidly grasp the system's potential. The guide will take you through a sequence of instructions to download and install the system, run it for the first time, fetch some data from your preferred exchanges, browse markets on the charts, run a first backtest with an existing strategy, and even try a live trading session, for demonstration purposes.

But, before you begin, it is highly reccommended that you <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" rel="nofollow" rel="noopener" target="_blank">install Chrome</a> and set it up as your default browser.

{% include note.html content="Use Chrome so that you have a similar environment as the dev team in case you need help. We are not testing on any other browsers, and it is a well-known fact that browsers behave differently." %}

## If You Are NOT on Windows

If you are running Mac OS, Linux or other operating systems, you will need to install Node JS, an open-source server environment required to run Superalgos. 

**1. Go to the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" rel="nofollow" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Node JS downloads page</a>**.

**2. Download your system's installer** (the *LTS Recommended for Most Users* version is enough).

**3. Run the installer** and go through the process until Node JS is fully installed.

{% include note.html content="Windows users may choose to install Node JS and run the system in the full version of the server too." %}
