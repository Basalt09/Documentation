The Superalgos Platform puts a powerful data processing system in your hands. Use it to the fullest and you will see your *intelligence* increasing by orders of magnitude.

Anyone may access raw trades and order book data from exchanges. Anyone may access information in the form of standard indicators and technical studies. 

However, only this platform allows you to perform custom calculations and any sort of processing over existing information, and store it into new datasets that you can later access from within your strategies.

The platform's data processing functionality is highly flexible and works under the same paradigm you are already familiar with while building strategies. It provides you with a visual interface and a framework that leads you through the process, with minimal coding skills required.

The vast majority of the complexity of processing data is handled internally by the bots and you don't really need to deal with that complexity or even understand it. The platform isolates complexity and only exposes you to the crucial elements that determine what you wish to accomplish.

This section of the User Manual will first provide you with some technical understanding of how data is handled by the platform. Once the theoretical framework is laid out, it will guide you through the process of modifying existing datasets and building your own.

The core of the functionality this section unveils covers—in essence—the following points:

* The capacity to define any number of calculation processes that may feed from each other's outputs, resulting in a wealth of *information* that may be consumed by trading strategies.

* The properties and characteristics of datasets resulting from the execution of such processes (how and where they are stored, in what format, how they are consumed internally and potentially by other systems).

We will first lay out the conceptual framework and explore the architecture, and only then go into the details of how to use the data processing functionality.
