This *Getting Started Guide* will quickly show you the very basics of the platform so that you can rapidly grasp the platform's potential. It will take you through a sequence of instructions that you need to follow to download and install the platform, run it for the first time, import an existing strategy, run your first backtest, and, if you are up for it, start trading live.

Please follow the version of the explanation that best suits your profile:

* [The quick version for experienced PC operators](#the-quick-version-for-experienced-pc-operators)
* [The extended version for regular folks](#the-extended-version-for-regular-folks)

## The Quick Version for Experienced PC Operators

### 1. Downloads

Download the software package from the [latest software release](https://github.com/Superalgos/DesktopApp/releases/tag/v.0.0.5-beta) (```Superalgos-Platform.zip```) and extract the file in an accessible route (you will launch the platform from the extracted folders).

Download historic market data from the [latest data release](https://github.com/Superalgos/DesktopApp/releases/tag/data.poloniex.btc.usdt.2019.12.06) (```Poloniex.BTC.USDT.Historic.Data.zip```) and extract the file inside the ```Superalgos Platform``` folder generated by the software ZIP package.

You should end up with the following folder structure:

> **NOTE:** Make sure the data ended up as the ```Data-Storage``` folder, right inside the ```Superalgos Platform``` root folder.

### 2. Continue with [Running the Platform](Running-the-Platform)

## The Extended Version for Regular Folks

### 1. Download the Software Package

Go to the [latest Superalgos Platform release](https://github.com/Superalgos/DesktopApp/releases/tag/v.0.0.5-beta) and download ```Superalgos-Platform.zip```.

### 2. Extract the ZIP File

How you extract/unpack the files depends on the software you use to handle ZIP files. Double-clicking the ZIP file should work in most scenarios, however, some systems may "open" the file instead of "extracting" or "unpacking" it. Make sure you are "extracting" and not just "opening" the file. You may also right-click the file and check the options available on the pop-up menu.

When you extract the ZIP file, a folder structure will be created with the root folder being ```Superalgos Platform```.

You may extract/unpack the files in any location of your drive, however, we recommend unpacking in an accessible route *(i.e.: ```C:\```)*, as you will later need to fit an additional folder inside the ```Superalgos Platform``` folder, and you will also need to access these folders every time you launch the platform.

### 3. Download the Data Package

For your convenience and [the reasons explained elsewhere](What-to-Expect), we maintain a market-data file that you can download, so that you may be up and running as quickly as possible.

Go to the [latest Data release](https://github.com/Superalgos/DesktopApp/releases/tag/data.poloniex.btc.usdt.2019.12.06) and download ```Poloniex.BTC.USDT.Historic.Data.zip```.

The ZIP file includes highly-compressed complete historic BTC/USDT Poloniex market data. Expect decompression to take from 30 to 60 minutes, depending on your system. Once you have the historic data, the platform will make sure the data stays up to date.

### 4. Extract the ZIP file

You need to extract the file inside the ```Superalgos Platform``` folder generated by the first ZIP file. You can achieve this in two ways:

A. Move ```Poloniex.BTC.USDT.Historic.Data.zip``` inside the ```Superalgos Platform``` folder, right-click the ZIP file and select *Extract here* in the pop-up menu. This is the quickest method.

B. Extract the ZIP file anywhere else and then move the resulting ```Data-Storage``` folder inside the ```Superalgos Platform``` folder. This will take more than double the time.

You should end up with the following folder structure:
