Dynamically rendering all the visual features we use on the platform tends to put a significant load on the machine's processor. Depending on your machine's capacity, this may result in the system getting slow and sometimes even unresponsive.

If you experience such symptoms, there are several workarounds you may implement to mitigate them:

## Display Less Data on the Charts

If you are zooming out too far in the horizontal time scale with too many candles on the screen, try zooming-in a bit or changing time frames so that candle density decreases.

You may also want to switch off the layers you may not be using. Remember, every piece of graphical information you see on screen represents data your system is reading from your disk and processing to display in a visual environment.

## Close Unused Hierarchies

The physics that govern nodes in the design space help the hierarchical structure of information to self-organize. This comes at a cost in terms of processing power.

Make sure the two exiting team hierarchies are closed:

* Hit <kbd>Ctrl or &#8984;</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (*M* for *Masters*) to go the the Masters team hierarchy and click ![minus](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13994516/70234850-d7528f00-1761-11ea-8a0b-d77ac483a0ea.png) if the hierarchy is open.

* Hit <kbd>Ctrl or &#8984;</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> (*S* for *Sparta*) to go the the Sparta team hierarchy and click ![minus](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13994516/70234850-d7528f00-1761-11ea-8a0b-d77ac483a0ea.png) if the hierarchy is open.

* Hit <kbd>Ctrl or &#8984;</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (*N* for *Network*) to go the the Network hierarchy and click ![minus](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13994516/70234850-d7528f00-1761-11ea-8a0b-d77ac483a0ea.png) if the hierarchy is open.

You may also want to close any of the structure of nodes in your trading system that you may not be using.

## Freeze the Nodes You Need to Remain Visible

You will find that freezing the nodes that you need to remain visible contributes to reducing the load in your CPU.

> **NOTE:** If these workarounds do not solve your problem and you often experience slowness or unresponsiveness when using your computer, you may want to consider upgrading your equipment. You shouldn't risk your capital with an insufficient trading infrastructure.
