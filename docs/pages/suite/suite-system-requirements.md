The Superalgos Platform is a web app, therefore, it is cross-platform. The team is testing mostly on Windows systems, but there are users running the platform on Mac OS and Linux systems as well.

The app has very little requirements for active, hands-on use, that is, for creating strategies, running backtests, or interacting with the charts, for instance. We believe any cheap laptop should run the app without a problem.

Requirements increase significantly when processes that fetch data from exchanges, calculate indicators and run live trading sessions are active.

The minimum hardware setup recommended for a dedicated machine running all processes to trade live, is 3 GB of RAM and a dual-core processor at 2.4 GHz. 

> **NOTE:** The above is a broad reference to the total RAM and processing power of the machine, not the specific requirements of the platform.

**Processing power is the key for comfortable operation.**

The following recommendations may make your life easier using this pre-release in beta stage:

* **We highly recommend you use Chrome to run the platform** so that you have a similar environment as developers in case you need help. We are not testing on any other browsers and it is a well-known fact that browsers do behave differently. 

* **You will benefit from having a decent Console / Command Line application** for similar reasons: we hope you won't need it, but in case you do, it may save you lots of hassle and make a difference troubleshooting and getting help from the community. We recommend [Console Emulator Cmder](https://cmder.net/).

## Deploying a VPS to Trade Live

The minimum hardware setup for a virtual machine (VM) or a virtual private server (VPS) destined to trade live is 3 GB of RAM and a dual-core processor at 2.4 GHz. This is recommended to minimize deployment costs. Under this configuration, the platform becomes slow to react to user input.  If such is the case, you should start the live trading session and minimize the browser for lower CPU and memory consumption.
