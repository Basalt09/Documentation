We highly appreciate bug reports. This is what you need to do:

**1.** Make sure you are running the latest release and that you have upgraded to the latest patch. You may find information about releases and patches on the [releases](https://github.com/Superalgos/Platform/releases) page. If you are not running the latest patch, please upgrade and test your issue again before reporting anything. We do not maintain of fix bugs on past versions.

**2.** Go to the [Issues](https://github.com/Superalgos/Platform/issues) page in this repository and take a moment to search for similar existing open issues. If you find one similar to yours, you may find helpful to follow the thread and may contribute by  commenting and introducing new information about the issue.

**3.** If there are no similar issues, then open a new one. Do your best to describe the problem as thoroughly as possible.

**Developers will be interested in knowing how to reproduce the issue in their systems, so please describe the process that leads to the issue as clearly as possible. Capturing a GIF video showing the steps that lead to the issue would be of great help!**

 [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) is a lightweight, simple platform that can help you with that. If developers can reproduce the issue, half of the problem is solved already.
 
 If the issue seems to happen under specific conditions, you might want to share your _Definitions_ with developers. To do this, go to the Definitions node in your workspace and select _Share_ in the menu. A file containing your strategy and other parameters, but NOT your API keys, will download to your browser's download folder. Upload this file to the issue only if you feel comfortable with sharing it openly. If not, then wait for developers to contact you.
 
 Please make sure you enable Github notifications when someone responds to the issue, as developers may want to ask questions.
 
 If the issue happens while using the platform at the browser, then please include a screen capture of Chrome's Console. Open DevTools with the F12 key (when the browser is in focus) and click the Console tab, then go back and reproduce the issue. Take a screen capture of the Console and paste it along with your report.
 
 Feel free to also include screen captures of the platform itself if there is anything relevant you wish to show to developers.
