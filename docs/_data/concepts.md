design_space: "The design space is the visual environment that features all the information available and that enables users to exert control over the whole system. You may think of the design space as your desktop."

workspace: "The workspace refers to the body of information managed by the system. Every data structure in the form of strategies, the configuration of different parts of the system, operational settings, and the relationships among them live within the workspace."

node: "A node is a small data structure containing information which may be related to market information, trading intelligence, the operation of the system or other concepts. They are visually represented by icons on the workspace."

structure_of_nodes: "Nodes may be chained together forming structures of nodes. In every structure of nodes, there is a parent node with offsprings. That is, a structure of nodes is a data structure composed of any node and its offspring."

parent-offspring_relationships: "Nodes in structures of nodes are chained to each other by so-called parent-offspring relationships. These relationships are visually represented by orange dotted lines, which may turn yellow or blue depending on certain visualization properties that the user may control. When nodes are chained together they form structures of nodes."

chain: "Nodes in the workspace may be unchained or detached from its parent, carrying all offspring with it. When a node is left unchained, it is no longer taken into account in the logic of the hierarchy, as it no longer belongs to it. When a node is chained back or reattached to the hierarchy, it goes back to being functional."

hierarchy: "A hierarchy is the representation of an overarching, top-level concept resulting in a long chain of nodes, usually with many ramifications. Currently, the system manages five different types of hierarchies: the crypto ecosystem, the charting space, trading systems, the network, and data mines."

reference: "A reference is a mechanism by which information in a node is related to, or accessed by, other nodes. The ability of a node to establish a reference with another node enables the first to access the information or features entailed in the second one."

session: "A session refers to a backtesting, paper trading, forward testing or live trading session. When the term is used without specifying the type of session, then it refers to the overall concept by which a trading bot instance&mdash;based on datasets exposed as products by other bots&mdash;applies the trading logic defined on a trading system in any of the aforementioned modes."

sensor_bot: "A sensor bot extracts raw data from external sources (*i.e.: exchanges, Twitter, etc.*)."

indicator_bot: "An indicator bot processes data to produce more elaborate datasets."

trading_bot: "Based on datasets exposed as products by other bots (counting sensors, indicators and even other trading bots), a trading bot applies the trading logic defined on a trading system to, on one side, generate a complete trading simulation (outputting datasets that include trades, the action of strategies, validation of conditions, etc.), and on the other side, manage the execution of orders when on a forward testing or live trading session."

superalgos_protocol: "In conceptual terms, the Superalgos Protocol determines the structure in which the information describing a trading system is stored and guides how traders shall create and automate strategies. In practical terms, the protocol results in a file with a specific format capable of holding all the information concerning any number and variety of strategies. In its current early version, the protocol is the description of a JSON object which defines the desired automation."

hierarchies_directory: "The hierarchies directory is the part of the documentation that features a description of the complete catalog of nodes of each hierachy"
