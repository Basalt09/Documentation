designer: "The designer is the portion of the system the controls all the information available and that enables to user to exert control over the whole system."

workspace: "The workspace refers to the visual environment that contains all information managed by the system. You may think of the workspace as your desktop."

node: "A node is a small data structure containing information which may be related to markets information, trading intelligence, the operation of the system or other concepts. They are visually represented by icons on the workspace."

structure_of_nodes: "Nodes may be linked together forming structures of nodes. In every structure of nodes, there is a parent node with offprings. That is, a structure of nodes is a data structure composed of any node and its offspring."

parent-offspring_relationships: "Nodes in structures of nodes are chained to each other by so-called parent-offspring relationships, which are visually represented by orange dotted lines, which may turn yellow or blue depending on certain visualization properties that the user may control. When nodes are chained together they form structures of nodes."

chain: "Nodes in the workspace may be unchained or detached from its parent, carrying all offspring with it. When a node is left unchained, it is no longer taken into account in the logic of the hierarchy, as it no longer belongs to it. When a node is chained back or reattached to the hierarchy, it goes back to being functional."

hierarchy: "A hierarchy is the representation of an overarching, top-level concept resulting in a long chain of nodes, usually with many ramifications. Currently, the system manages five different types of hierarchies: Charting Space, Crypto Ecosystem, Trading Systems, Network, and Data Mines."

reference: "A reference is a mechanism by which information in a node is related to, or accessed by, other nodes. The ability of a node to establish a reference with another node enables the first to access the information or features entailed in the second one."

session: "A session refers to a backtesting, paper trading, forward testing or live trading session. When the term is used without specifying the type of session, then it refers to the overall concept by which a trading bot instance&mdash;based on datasets exposed as products by other bots&mdash;applies the trading logic defined on a trading system in any of the aforementioned modes."

sensor_bot: "A sensor bot extracts raw data from external sources (*i.e.: exchanges, Twitter, etc.*)."

indicator_bot: "An indicator bot processes data to produce more elaborate datasets."

trading_bot: "Based on datasets exposed as products by other bots (counting sensors, indicators and even other trading bots), a trading bot applies the trading logic defined on a trading system to, on one side, generate a complete trading simulation (outputting datasets that include trades, the action of strategies, validation of conditions, etc.), and on the other side, manage the execution of orders when on a forward testing or live trading session."
