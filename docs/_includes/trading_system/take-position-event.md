The trigger-on event merely selects a strategy to be considered for trading under the current market situation. The actual decision to enter a position may require more specific conditions to be met. For that reason, the take position event is a separate entity from the trigger-on event.

Therefore, the take position event is defined with its own set of situations and conditions.

Once the take position event is triggered, the decision to take a position has been made and there is nothing else to consider in that regard. Therefore, the system shifts from the trigger stage to the open stage.
