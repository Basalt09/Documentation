A trading system may have multiple strategies designed for the same market, with the same base asset.

An important aspect of trading systems is that they are allocated a certain amount of capital (see the base asset parameter). As a consequence, strategies within a trading system have to share that capital allocation. 

The logic behind the concept of the trigger stage assumes that different strategies within a trading system are specialized for trading in different market conditions. The trigger stage in each strategy is, therefore, the mechanism by which any particular strategy may be selected to trade, given any particular market situation.

The triggering-on of a strategy effectively blocks the selection of any other strategy in the trading system, and reserves the whole capital allocation for a potential trade, until the strategy is triggered-off.

As a corollary, if certain strategies are meant to trade under the same market situations and open trades concurrently, then those strategies should be put in separate trading systems.

To add a trigger stage node, select *Add Missing Stages* on the strategy node menu. All stages that may be missing are created along with the rest of the basic structure of nodes required to define each of them and their events.
