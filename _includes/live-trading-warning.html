As such, errors may occur at any point, including errors that may cause you to lose money. You are responsible for taking all precautions before starting trading live. Make sure you test with small amounts of money. Even if you take all possible precautionary measures, things may still go wrong and errors may occur. By using this software to trade live despite the warnings, you acknowledge that you are aware of the inherent risks of trading and of using software for that purpose. The Superalgos Project offers the software AS IS, with no explicit or implied warranties of any kind. The project, the software, the superalgos.org website, this documentation, and the Community do not offer financial advice. Although the strategies shipping with the system may be fully functional, Superalgos does not make any express or implied recommendation as to how you should use them. We share strategies for educational purposes only. Trade live under your responsibility and at your own risk.</div>
