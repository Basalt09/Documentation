# Coding Style Definition

## Introduction

The purpose of these considerations when writing the code for the modules is to align some aspects that will bring what we call simplicity. Since this is very subjective we explain it by setting the scenario for the code style.

Rapid-evolution and collaboration can only exist if the entry barrier is low and thus we need to make sure we write code that could be followed by all auditors and potential developers that could join the team in the future.

#### Code Considerations should be applied when possible, not meant to be a strict rule, but to guide common concepts among the team.

## Coding for dummies

The code should be self documented and who is coming after not necessary will know details about other components on the software and dependencies.


## Code formatter

The code formatter used should be: https://standardjs.com
The format file will be shared so it could be used as plug and play.


## Async calls with the callback function

There are different approaches to manage synchronic method calls. We consider it's best to use callback functions.
Avoid nesting callback functions when possible.

## Name variables and functions without abbreviations

Is an opportunity to document what the function or variable represent, who is reading the code don't necessary know the dependencies. Donâ€™t' miss this opportunity.

## Limit to strictly needed dependencies


## Avoid anonymous functions


## Project structure and source file name convention

TBD

## Logs management

- On web clients components, output to console during development. It will be removed on production build.
- On server side components, work with https://github.com/winstonjs/winston


## Error handling

- On web clients components, will be managed on the higher order component.
- On server side components, every function with a try catch, on errors: log and return the global failure code.
