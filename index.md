summary: "This is the documentation for the Superalgos Project, a crypto-intelligence suite enabling the automation of complex trading strategies and robust market data processing. Getting started with Superalgos is really easy: you may choose to follow a series of video tutorials, or follow written instructions instead. The video series is richer in explanations, while the written series is more concise and to-the-point."

## About this Documentation

This is the documentation site for the Superalgos Project, as described [on the website](https://superalgos.org/), and it's in a permanent work-in-progress state, pretty much like the Superalgos software itself.

Once you are up and running with Superalgos, the rest of the documentation covers all concepts managed by the system. However, we acknowledge that a *How to* section is required. We will deliver it as soon as possible. The current focus, however, is placed in the video tutorials series.

## Beta Stage Notice

This is a pre-release in beta stage. The system is under heavy development. We appreciate your help in testing the system and reporting any errors you may experience. We will keep improving user experience with your feedback.
