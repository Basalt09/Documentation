## About this Documentation

This is the documentation site for the Superalgos Project, as described [on the website](https://superalgos.org/), and it's in a permanent state of work-in-progress, pretty much like the system itself.

Reading this documentation in a linear manner starting with these *Before you begin* pages and the *Getting started* guide is ideal.

The rest of the documentation covers all concepts managed by the system. However, we acknowledge that a *How to* section is required and is the current focus. Also pending are documentation-wide illustrations.

## Beta Stage Notice

This is a pre-release in beta stage. The system is under heavy development. We appreciate your help in testing the system and reporting any errors you may experience. We will keep improving user experience with your feedback.
