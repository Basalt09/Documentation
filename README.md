# Documentation

This repository holds the latest documentation of Superalgos including content refering to unreleased functionality and features. For the documentation corresponding to the current release, see the [Users Manual](https://github.com/Superalgos/Platform/wiki) in the Platform repository's wiki.

The ```docs``` folder in this branch features the source files for a new [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) documentation site to be deployed along with the next release. The new version of the documentation is undergoing a massive restructuring, therefore, it may currently be inconsistent or hard to follow.
